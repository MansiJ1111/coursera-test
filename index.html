It is then placed in a cradle. Everyone swings the cradle to the tune of bhajan's or songs of praise. The atmosphere is filled with joy and exultation as everyone rejoices the birth of Vishnu's incarnation who has been born to give security to the suffering humanity.

			<h2>Diwali</h2>
                <p>
		        Diwali, or Dipawali, is India's biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This festival is as important to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians.Over the centuries, Diwali has become a national festival that's also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities.
